# UNP-Project_BI-with-MySQL_Maven-market.
I completed this project as part of my MySQL internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP).

About the data: I received a dataset from Maven Market comprising tables on customer data, transactions, regions, stores, returns, and products.

Transformation: Utilized MySQL for data transformation. Established an original database, created necessary tables, and defined columns with detailed attributes. Identified and set primary and secondary keys for each table. Created a backup database to address date format inconsistencies. Altered the database to ensure uniformity in date formats. Inserted the transformed data back into the original database.

Queries: Employed MySQL syntax to solve queries and gather insights on Maven Market: Query Examples: Calculate the average cost per product, Summarize sales per store, Calculate the overall revenue from transactions, Identify the top 5 returned products by count, etc.
